  abstract={We introduce the problem of groundwater trading, capturing the emergent groundwater
market setups among stakeholders in a given groundwater basin. The agents optimize
their production, taking into account their available water rights, the requisite water
consumption, and the opportunity to trade water among themselves. We study the
resulting Nash equilibrium, providing a full characterization of the 1-period setting and
initial results about the features of the multi-period game driven by the ability of agents
to bank their water rights in order to smooth out the intertemporal shocks.}
