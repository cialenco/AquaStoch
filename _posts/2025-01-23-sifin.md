# A Stochastic Game Framework for Groundwater Markets

Regulatory frameworks such as California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) have accelerated the need for market-based mechanisms to manage aquifer depletion[cite: 7, 8]. In  {%cite cialenco2025groundwater %}Cialenco and Ludkovski (2025) we introduce a stochastic dynamic game model to analyze these emerging groundwater markets, where stakeholders (farmers) optimize production and trading decisions under physical and regulatory constraints.

### The Model

We model the interaction as a non-cooperative game among $J$ economic agents. Each agent $j$ maximizes the expected utility of their profit and loss (P\&L), denoted as $L_j(t)$. The P\&L is derived from agricultural production revenue and proceeds from water trading $\psi_j(t)$ at the market price $p(t)$:

$$
L_{j}(t):=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\overline{f}_{j}^{k}(t,\varphi_{j}^{k})\cdot\varphi_{j}^{k}(t)+\psi_{j}(t)\cdot p(t)
$$

Here, $\varphi_{j}^{k}$ represents the quantity of crop $k$ produced, and $\overline{f}_{j}^{k}$ is the net profit per unit. The system dynamics are driven by exogenous groundwater recharge $R(t)$ and the ability of agents to "bank" water for future periods. The water available to agent $j$ evolves according to:

$$
W_{j}(t+1)=W_{j}(t)+\theta_{j}R(t+1)-C_{j}(t)-\psi_{j}(t)
$$

where $\theta_j$ is the agent's share of recharge and $C_j(t)$ is water consumption.

### Equilibrium Dynamics

In a single-period static setting, the market clears at a Pareto optimal price $p^\circ$, defined by the intersection of aggregate demand and total available water[cite: 217, 218].

However, in a multi-period setting, the option to bank water introduces non-zero-sum game effects. gents must balance current profits against future scarcity, with their banking decisions $b_j(t)$ impacting future market prices for all participants[cite: 241]. The Nash Equilibrium is characterized by the fixed point of the agents' best response curves, $b_j^* = B_j(b_{-j}^*)$.

*Figure 2: Best response curves $\bar{b}_{-j} \mapsto B_j(\bar{b}_{-j})$ for a two-period market. The intersection marks the equilibrium banking strategies.*

This framework highlights that while banking generally benefits individual agents by smoothing intertemporal shocks, rational smoothing behavior can negatively impact competitors by altering future water valuations.
